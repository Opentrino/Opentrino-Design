**Microarchitecture definition**: The internal mechanism of a microprocessor that is completely hidden from the Programmer/Compiler. 
It's the heart/core/most important component of a Microprocessor, as it actually describes how the CPU works internally.

# **Pipelines**

# **Superscalar**
  Short Definition: Parallelism (more than 1 instruction at a time) on a single core throughout multiple pipelines.
